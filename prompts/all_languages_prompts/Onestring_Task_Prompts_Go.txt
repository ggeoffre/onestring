TASK 1 - GO DATA (MONGO)
+++

  The String: {"recorded": 1768570200,"location": "den","sensor": "bmp280","measurement": "temperature","units": "C","value": 22.3}

  1. Create a go function to connect to a mongo database
  2. Create a go function that will store the following string into a mongo database
  3. Create a go function that will retrieve the following string from a mongo database
  4. Create a go function that will delete the following string from a mongo database
  5. Create a main function that will call each of the functions
  6. Create a go.mod file to include all requirements in this source file
  7. Modify all five functions into one source file using this string as the string that is being stored:

  A. Create a go function that will update any value in the key value pair of a mutable map
  B. Create a go function that will generate a random number between 22.4 and 34.1, limited to one decimal place of precision
  C. Create a go function that will generate the integer value of the current Unix Epoch Timestamp
  D. Create a go function that will update both the "recorded" value with the current Unix Epoch Timestamp, and the "value" with a random number between 22.4 and 34.1, using the following string as input:
  E. Modify the original code to pass-in/insert a randomized string into the mongo database each time the code is run
  F. Create a go function that will remove any key/value pair from a map (like "id" or "_id")
  G. Combine all of the above to create a small helper file that works with the OneString JSON data (generate sample data, validate required fields, and convert JSON to CSV). This helper should be simple utility code and can be called directly.

        { "recorded" : 1768570200, "location" : "den", "sensor" : "bmp280", "measurement" : "temperature", "units" : "C", "value" : 22.3 }

  D. can you do this without using the crate csv
  E. return the csv string as a downloadable file, be sure to modify the headers of the response
  F. return string message as a JSON object

  1. create a very basic web app using the go language gin framework
  2. what would the go.mod file look like for this main.go file
  3. how do i modify the gin app to bind to any ip address and a specific port when it runs
  4. add routes for the following:
      GET /
      POST /echo
      POST /log
      GET /report
      POST or GET /purge

  The String: {"recorded": 1768570200,"location": "den","sensor": "bmp280","measurement": "temperature","units": "C","value": 22.3}

  This second lego assignment assumes that you have already successfully implemented and tested the Legos assignment for this language once already:

  I. copy the entire api solution from the previous API exercise of the gin framework
  II. copy all of the data source files you modified in the first implementation of legos using the echo framework
  III. cut/paste the same dependency injection function from the first implementation of legos using the echo framework

  1. For each of the three functions of the gin framework create a connection to the appropriate type interface for each route (/log, /report, & /purge)
  2. Reuse the OneString helper from earlier tasks for generating, validating, and formatting data. Treat it as a simple utility that can be called directly from the application code.

  NOTE: this time the type interface function for each of the databases should already be implemented

NOTES FOR ALL TASKS & DATABASES
+++

For each task, generate the appropriate go.mod file for Go.

For each task, be sure to follow the Go naming conventions:
 Files - snake_case or simply lowercasewords
 Structs, Functions, Methods, Variables and Constants:
   UpperCamelCase if exported (public).
   lowerCamelCase if unexported (private).

For the Cassandra database, use the following schema for a table named "sensor_data" in a keyspace named "sensor_data_db":
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sensor_data (
   recorded bigint,
   location text,
   sensor text,
   measurement text,
   units text,
   value double,
   PRIMARY KEY (recorded, location, sensor)
  );

For the MySQL database, use the following schema for a table named "sensor_data" in a database named "sensor_data_db":
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sensor_data (
   recorded BIGINT NOT NULL,
   location VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   sensor VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   measurement VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   units VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
   value DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL
  );

For the Postgres database, use the following schema for a table named "sensor_data" in a database named "sensor_data_db":
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sensor_data (
   recorded BIGINT NOT NULL,
   location VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   sensor VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   measurement VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   units VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   value NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL
  );

For the Redis database, use the List data type by using rpush and lrange to store and retrieve for the key "sensor_data_db:sensor_data"

For Go's implementation of Dependency Injection to achieve Inversion of Control, use a type interface
