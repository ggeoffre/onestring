This assignment walks you through setting up a simple Python + Mongo environment, writing basic functions to store, retrieve, update, and delete a standard OneString JSON record, running the code, and then converting those functions into refined AI prompts that consistently regenerate the same working code. The goal is to establish a repeatable workflow for handling the OneString payload and to build a reliable library of prompts before expanding to other languages and databases. Python and Mongo are used first because they’re the easiest, most forgiving pair: Python minimizes boilerplate and errors, Mongo stores JSON natively, and together they let you focus on mastering prompt design rather than debugging complex language or database issues.



{
    "recorded" : 1768570200,
    "location" : "den",
    "sensor" : "bmp280",
    "measurement" : "temperature",
    "units" : "C",
    "value" : 22.3
}


I. Start Your Development Environment (recommend using python and mongo):

  1. Launch Docker Desktop, and use the terminal within Docker Desktop to:
    A. Run a mongo database docker container

      docker run --name mongo-container -p 27017:27017 -d mongo:8.2.2

    B. Run a python docker container and attach to the mongo database container

      docker run --name python-container -p 8080:8080 -v ~/Workspace/projects/:/usr/src/python -d python:3.13.5 sleep infinity

  2. Launch VS Code, Open Folder, and Create a Terminal to:
    A. Connect to the python container from teh VS Code Terminal

      docker exec -it -w /usr/src/python python-container /bin/bash

  3. Create the following file structure within VS Code:
    ./python/data
    ./python/data/main.py
    ./python/data/mongo_data.py
    ./python/data/requirements.txt


II. Modify the following prompts to be language and database specific (recommend using python and mongo):

  1. Create a python function to connect to a mongo database
  2. Create a python function that will store the following string into a mongo database
  3. Create a python function that will retrieve the following string from a mongo database
  4. Create a python function that will delete the following string from a mongo database
  5. Create a main function that will call each of the functions
  6. Create a requirements.text file to include all requirements in this source file
  7. Modify all five methods into one source file using this string as the string that is being stored:

  The String:
  {"recorded": 1768237200,"location": "den","sensor": "bmp280","measurement": "temperature","units": "C","value": 22.3}


III. Run your python Code

  python --version
  pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python app.py


IV. Once fully operational, copy each of the four functions individually, and add it to the following AI prompt...

  "Using the following source code, generate an AI prompt that would produce this code:"

    compared to...

  "Using the following source code to generate an AI prompt, using simple english, that would produce this code:"

    NOTE: Cute/paste the code you generated above that sucessfully ran.


V. Now take all of the original prompts from II above, and add it to the following AI prompt...

  "How could each of these prompts be written in a manner to produce 'better' code:"

    NOTE: use any instruction to replace 'better' (like cleaner, efficient, optimized, readable, concise, performant, scalable, maintainable, secure, etc.)


EXTRA PROMPTS TO TRY:

  A. Create a python function that will update any value in the key value pair of a mutable dictionary
  B. Create a python function that will generate a random number between 22.4 and 34.1, limited to one decimal place of precision
  C. Create a python function that will generate the integer value of the current Unix Epoch Timestamp
  D. Create a python function that will update both the "recorded" value with the current Unix Epoch Timestamp, and the "value" with a random number between 22.4 and 34.1, using the following string as input:

    The String:
    {"recorded": 1768237200,"location": "den","sensor": "bmp280","measurement": "temperature","units": "C","value": 22.3}

  E. Modify the original code to pass-in/insert a randomized string into the mongo database each time the code is run
  F. Create a python function that will remove any key/value pair from a dictionary (like "id" or "_id")

  Now run the generated code and these prompts back through AI as you did in IV and V previously.


BEYOND MONGO & PYTHON:

  Use the same technique for other databases like Postgres, MySQL, Redis and Cassandra
  Use the same technique for other languages like Go, Java, Rust and Swift
