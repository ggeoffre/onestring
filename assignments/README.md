Here you will find the assignments for the OneString course as well as the solutions.  The code is separated into two main sections:

**<ins><u>data_storage</u></ins>**

This is where you will find all of the code related to storing teh one string.  Go, Java, Python, Rust and Swift solutions are provided using echo, gin, quarkus, spring, django, flask, actix, axum, and vapor api services connecting to cassandra, mongo, mysql, postgres and redis databases.

**<ins><u>data_collection</u></ins>**

This is where you will find all of the code related to collecting the one string.  Arduino, Circuitpython, ESP-IDF, MicroPython, and Pico-SDK can be found here.  Under each microcontroler platform you will finde a folder for each sensor implemented.
