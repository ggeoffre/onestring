This exercise guides you through building a minimal web service using Python and Flask, creating a simple project structure, defining basic routes, running the server, and then converting your working code into refined AI prompts that reliably reproduce the same application. The goal is to establish a clean, repeatable workflow for generating web-framework code before expanding to more complex stacks. Flask is chosen first because it is lightweight, easy to configure, and flexible enough to expose routes with minimal boilerplate—letting you focus on prompt design instead of framework quirks or heavy scaffolding. This small, low-friction setup creates the foundation for later extending the same technique to other Python frameworks and to full web stacks in Go, Java, Rust, and Swift.



{
    "recorded" : 1768570200,
    "location" : "den",
    "sensor" : "bmp280",
    "measurement" : "temperature",
    "units" : "C",
    "value" : 22.3
}


I. Start Your Development Environment (recommend using python and flask):

  1. Launch Docker Desktop, and use the terminal within Docker Desktop to:
    A. Run a python docker container and attach to the mongo database container

      docker run --name python-container -p 8080:8080 -v ~/Workspace/projects/:/usr/src/python -d python:3.13.5 sleep infinity

  2. Launch VS Code, Open Folder, and Create a Terminal to:
    A. Connect to the python container from the VS Code Terminal

      docker exec -it -w /usr/src/python python-container /bin/bash

  3. Create the following file structure within VS Code:
    ./python/api/flask-app/flask-app
    ./python/api/flask-app//app.py
    ./python/api/flask-app/requirements.txt


II. Modify the following prompts to be language and framework specific (recommend using python and flask):

    1. create a very basic web app using the python language flask framework
    2. what would the requirements.txt file look like for this main.py file
    3. how do i modify the flask app to bind to any ip address and a specific port when it runs
    4. add routes for the following:
        GET /
        POST /echo
        POST /log
        GET /report
        POST or GET /purge


III. Run your python Code

  python --version
  pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python app.py


IV: Create your own AI/LLM prompts that will generate a test script:

    * Using WGET or CURL, create a test script that will test the following functions:
        * GET /
        * POST /echo
        * POST /log
        * GET /report
        * POST or GET /purge

    NOTE: this depends on what your local operating system supports, as
    these test scripts should run outside of the python docker container


V. Once fully operational, copy each of the four functions individually, and add it to the following AI prompt...

  "Using the following source code, generate an AI prompt that would produce this code:"

    compared to...

  "Using the following source code to generate an AI prompt, using simple english, that would produce this code:"

    NOTE: Cute/paste the code you generated above that sucessfully ran.


VI. Now take all of the original prompts from II above, and add it to the following AI prompt...

  "How could each of these prompts be written in a manner to produce 'better' code:"

    NOTE: use any instruction to replace 'better' (like cleaner, efficient, optimized, readable, concise, performant, scalable, maintainable, secure, etc.)


EXTRA PROMPTS:

    A. return the exact same JSON object that is sent in on the HTTP POST request
    B. create a static string constant for the following JSON structure:
        { "recorded" : 1768570200, "location" : "den", "sensor" : "bmp280", "measurement" : "temperature", "units" : "C", "value" : 22.3 }
    C. create a method or function to convert a json string to a csv string, using the keys as the column names
    D. can you do this without using the crate csv
    E. return the csv string as a downloadable file, be sure to modify the headers of the response
    F. return string message as a JSON object
    G. use the WGET/CURL test script you created above to generate a postman file for importing the API endpoints

  Now run the generated code and these prompts back through AI as you did in IV and V previously.


BEYOND FLASK & PYTHON:

  Use the same technique for another python framework like django
  Use the same technique for other languages and frameworks like Go gin, Java spring, Rust acix and Swift vapor
